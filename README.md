## Introduction

This exercise requires the use of pandas library, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib libraries to analyse the tumor growth in 249 mice after taken the drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. This exercise will include and required the following tasks: 

1. Identify and remove any duplicate data.

2. Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

3. Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot.

4. Generate a pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot.

5. Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens. 

6. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

7. Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers.

8. Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.

9. Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

10. Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. 

11. Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
